    SQL or Structured Query Language is a method of access and retrieving data that is stored in a database. When you want to look at data from rows in multiple tables you may need to join them together, with methods like innerjoin. Innerjoin works when both tables have the same column in them. Innerjoin will select of all the rows that have the same value in the column that is found in both tables.

    The role of a data scientist is to look for meaning, patterns, and trends in data. One of the main ways that they do this is through a variety of different algorithms. People who may be a business analyst may look at the data and come up with some hypotheses about the meaning of it or trend in it, but data scientist look much deeper into the data to confirm any of these hypotheses and reveal more information. One of the ways that data scientist are different from computer scientist is that they are less focused on programming and are more concerned with knowledge of math and statistics which are very relevant to data science.
